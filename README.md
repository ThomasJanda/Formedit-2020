# Formedit 2020 (alpha)

Web IDE based on vue, vuex. Goal is to implement full business application with database binding and without a line of code only by a visual editor.
But keep the flexibility to add your own scripts.

Previous project: https://github.com/ThomasJanda/Formedit-2019

**Goals:**
1. Create a project within the editor
2. Save the project within a file which contain the complete information about the layout, database bindings....
3. Execute the file within a interpreter which display the app in the browser

By that, it should be possible to execute in modern browsers (desktop/mobile) or as a desktop application (Electron) or any other device the interpreter runs.
